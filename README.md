# My-HealthData-Core
Patients struggle with the fact that HCPs are not usually updated on their situation, which means they need to explain their story over and over. Data and documents are not shared quickly enough between HCPs, and often patients lose track of their medical reports. Patients would like to have a safe space where they and their doctors can access their data. A common data channel would also help address the current lack of interprofessional collaboration and communication. Furthermore, patients would have the ability to provide supporting documents (reports, prescriptions) in urgent situations.

## Patient champion interaction and other stakeholders:

## Description of the solution:
What is the approach? What does it do? How does it work? Which resources does it require?
What are the benefits? And who benefits from our solution?

## Our Milestones, achievements and prototype

## Challenges we encountered

## Resources that we used

## Contact / promotion channels on our social media

## Our takeaways and learnings

## WhatÂ´s next:
how we would like to proceed and what we need to do so
