## Summary
Patients see multiple practioners at numerous institutions throughout their treatment journey. My Data Core centralizes and makes data records easily accessible. The benefits are reduction in time, clarity in health data, reduction in costs.
 
## The challenge:
*From our perspective, what was the main problem that we set out to solve?*

Doctors have to generate diagnosis with a limited amount of information, far smaller than the existing amount of health data collected by all other doctors. This situation leads to repeat unnecessary, sometime painful, medical investigations because of the lack of accessibility between health data.
We aimed to offer a free, efficient and scalable solution to patients willing to centralise and share his health data between the medical doctors. The application was designed to exhibit the following features:
- Be accessible from mobile and the web
- Display the medical history while giving access to the specific document upon a simple action
- Easy upload of health data
- Allow for secured and fast data transfer

## Patient champion interaction and other stakeholders:
*how did we interact to design a solution that meets the needs of the stakeholders?*

[Champion E.T. (7)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2020.healthhack.solutions/project/20&sa=D&ust=1603408444985000&usg=AOvVaw1vMYLQc0AksKvDYG6NGEmS) provided us with her medical experience and helped us to define the relevant features of My-Health-DataCore.

[Champion S.R. (8)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2020.healthhack.solutions/project/21&sa=D&ust=1603408444983000&usg=AOvVaw1xwmbnQQLHt4Sbpo38LzlA) helped us to set up the project on the DayOne Health Hack platform.

## Description of the solution:
*What is the approach? What does it do? How does it work? Which resources does it require?
What are the benefits? And who benefits from our solution?*

My HealthData Core is a light app, working on mobiles and websites and allowing for
- display a calendar with links to documents
- upload data with the website or the mobile camera
- define the persons allowed to access specific documents
